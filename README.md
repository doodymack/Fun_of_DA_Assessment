What is the project:


Project Definition
- GitHub Repository
- Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks

â€“ these are described further down. The repository should contain the following:

- A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks. (10%)
- A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such as data files and image files.(10%)

Pyplot Notebook
- Include a Jupyter notebook called pyplot.ipynb that contains the following.

- A clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package [3],pitched at your classmates. (15%)
- An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the matplotlib.pyplot Python package [3]. You have free reign to choose the three plots yourself.(25%)


CAO Points Notebook
- Include a Jupyter notebook called 'CAO points.ipynb' that contains the following.

 - clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points info from the CAO website into a PANDAS dataframe (10%)
 - Detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019,2020,2021 using the functionality in pandas (20%)
 - Appropriate plots and other visuaizations to enhance your notebook for viewers (10%)
 
 Project Plan:
 
- Include Your Project's Title. This is the name of the project. ...

Write a Description.   
- what it does, technology used, challenges
- Elevator phrase of the project
Add a Table of Contents (Optional) ...

How to Install Your Project. ...
- what you need to run the notebook i.e. need to have Python 3 installed.  Anaconda recommended.
- Install jupyter (to run the notebook)
- above not very enlightening
- 'need a python environment'
- 'packages and dependencies are in my requirements.txt file '
- 'easist way to do that is to just install anaconda ..'
- python is 40Mb. Anaconda is huge.
- talk them through that the key file is ipynb file.
- jupyter starts off in web browser but is running on your machine
- give pointers:  kernel clear outputs, run all to run the program cells
- how to interact with the package recommend to pitch to an employer
- who is computer literate but dosent know python

- include credits: if e.g. closely followed tutorial
- mentionm where you used a e.g. blogpost or website.  Give the author the credit.
- put a comment in notebook if used code from stackoverflow no need to add in README

- list the licence if have one- of if not rely on the default

- Badged: NB viewer  binder.  Badges are images that look like badges

Add contact details if you want

Troubleshooting:
- if you get a warning then e.g. ignore, rerun cell

Conclusion:
- what you would do with this project in future- what could others do with it
